    <h1>How SecureShield Protects Secrets</h1>
</section>

<section class="panel">
    <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Text, photos, and videos are encrypted in your browser using AES-GCM before upload.</li>
        <li>Server stores ciphertext only and never plaintext content.</li>
        <li>The decryption key is kept in URL fragment (<code>#...</code>) and not sent in HTTP request line.</li>
        <li>Each share has a generated 6-digit access code that must be entered on reveal page.</li>
        <li>Secrets auto-expire and are deleted after allowed view count.</li>
        <li>Security headers and rate limits are enabled by default.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
        For production, deploy behind HTTPS and place it behind a managed database and WAF.
